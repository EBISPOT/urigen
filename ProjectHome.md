# Overview #
URIGen is a Java API and web service for managing the creation of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI). URIGen provides collaborative ontology development projects, like [EFO](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo) and [SWO](http://theswo.sourceforge.net), with a centralised server to manage their URI creation policy.  URIGen provides a REST interface, a web client and a Protege 4.1 plugin for interacting with the URIGen server.
